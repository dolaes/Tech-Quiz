# Tech Quiz

## Description

This project is a tech quiz that asks the user 10 random questions to test their knowledge. After completing the quiz, the user has the option to retake it with a new set of questions. The goal of this project was to integrate Cypress component and end-to-end (e2e) testing into the tech quiz program to ensure it runs smoothly and accurately.
